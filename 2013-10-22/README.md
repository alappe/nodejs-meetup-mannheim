### Automate common tasks with grunt

This was a live session where Christian walked us through the steps
of his setup to automate common tasks. If you've missed it, I'm sure
you can ping him to sum it up for you…

### Deploy node.js apps

This deck of slides shows two ways to deploy node.js apps (or any
other kind of software for that matter) with chef (both handmade
and using the deploy-resource) and with jenkins.

Automate all the things!
