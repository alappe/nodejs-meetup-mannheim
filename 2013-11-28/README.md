# node.js MeetUp Mannheim November

Thirteen people attended this meetup at stocard in Ludwigshafen.

## Presentations

### Measure Everything

The presentation by [@alappe](https://twitter.com/alappe)
was trying to give a quick glance on what
graphite and statsd are in comparison to a SAAS like New Relic
and see what both can do for you.

See the
[README](Presentations/Monitor-Everything-code/README.md) if you
want to try the code locally.
